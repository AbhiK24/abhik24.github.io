In 2017, I with some of my closest friends started a prize (with money attached) to incentivise creation of good B.Tech Projects at our university, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, Lonere. The prize was named "AWK Prize For Best Bachelor Thesis."

Over time we have realised that the incentive should be given to younger students who are in the learning system, so we have made some changes recently. 

The prize will now be called "AWK Prize For Outstanding Project". The prize is named after the former head of department of Computer Engineering, Dr. Arvind W. Kiwelekar who has dedicated his whole professional career teaching at DBATU. 

Here are the details:

1. Prize to given to students of 2nd-year / 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Engineering. (3rd sem to 6th sem). This will be an open application process and student/group can submit a project whenever they are ready.

2. The prize has to be awarded to a student/group creating great technology projects that solve a specific problem and not to academic performance. Prize money is restricted to Rs.2000 per student. If a group wins the prize, the prize money is restricted to Rs. 5000.

3. A committee made up of Head of Department (Computer Engineering), Dr Kiwelekar Sir, Dr Netak Sir, 2 industry representatives (appointed by funding committee) will decide on the winners.

4. The prize winners and the runners up student/group might be given an internship opportunity.

5. The prize money will be awarded directly to the students/groups. We will make use of the ACES bank account to route the prize money, to make sure the incentives are delivered on time.
