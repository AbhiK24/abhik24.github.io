These are the questions discussed at a meeting of educationists, artists, theatre professionals and other professionals who gathered to think about ways we can design art and education for non-neurotypical children. I will update this blog as we find more ideas and references.

1. How do we recognise and understand the special needs of children?
2. How do cultural spaces like Ranga Shankara and others create programmes that make art more accessible for non-neurotypical children?
3. Should art for non-neurotypical children be an individual experience or be a community experience?
4. How do we think about the issue that children with special needs will become adults with special needs?
5. Why are the differences between non-neurotypical and neurotypical children highlighted and the commonalities ignored?
6. How can we we ensure that all classes of children learn from each other?
7. How can we incorporate more human in stories and art designed for non-neurotypical children?
8. What is the level of our preparedness to handle and care for non-neurotypical children at the ground level in terms of facilities and training?
9. How practical or beneficial is it to have a single classroom or theatre for all classes and kinds of children?
10. How do you raise children at home and school so that they celebrate differences so that they work and play together with a broad range of children?
11. How do we enable children with special needs not only from just a functional perspective but also from a holistic perspective? How do we look at the whole picture when it comes to special children?
12. Why cant a child “just be”? Why do we expect children “to be something”?
13. How can we discover the abilities of special children?
14. What is the right time for the child to compete?
15. How do we enable kids with special needs to overcome social anxiety?
16. Do we have to re-examine the whole labelling paradigm for special children? For eg. “Special needs”, “Differently abled”, etc.
17. Who do we work with to create an inclusive space for special children which is sensitive to their needs?
18. How do we combat adult age privilege and create safe spaces for children where they can vocalize and explore?
19. If mainstream education does not foster creativity, how should we create a space where non-neurotypical children and neurotypical children can come together to create art?
20. Is integration of special needs children inside the mainstream really possible?
21. As a parent how do I make it possible for my child to interact better with special children?
22. How can parents and schools work together to get better outcomes for special children?
23. How can we design activities that are inclusive where a variety of kids with different abilities can come together to create something by contributing in their own way?
