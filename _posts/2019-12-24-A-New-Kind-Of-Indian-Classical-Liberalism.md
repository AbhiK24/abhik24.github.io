“One night I dreamt of a 20th century India led by C. Rajagopalachari, and I could not sleep again. Oh, the lost opportunity!”

As India stands on the crossroads yet again with the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in both the houses of the parliament, and the wide protests thereafter, one of the major feeling that overcomes me is loss. India currently is going to waste a good crisis to reshape its polity and present different options to the people.

I am confused and strikingly impressed by the execution and passing of the Modi-Shah government while passing these bills and at the same time I am more surprised by the amount and unity of protest that has flared up. This indicates a common message by the people of India that they broadly reject the CAA and the ensuing NRC.

Here, I feel there is no point in debating whether the ruling BJP is interested in NRC or not. They are. That is the end of that debate. What I am more confused by the random and sudden use of the term fascism. I am no fan of the Modi government but the use of such terms loosely does make me wonder if the main faces of the anti-CAA protests are bestowing too much self importance. The passing of the CAB is NOT fascist. It was an election manifesto promise, passed in both the houses constitutionally. But the government has disgraced itself by the way police has been handling protests in various parts of the country. The liberal use of Sec 144, internet shutdowns and the brute force violence used by police forces is condemnable and shameful. But I still feel the equivalency with fascism and Hitler are not suitable. 

TM Krishna, the renowned Carnatic singer and a cultural commentator I respect a lot, recently said that “the biggest problem of liberals in the country is creating a dominant narrative condescending of faith, religions and rituals.” Appropriately talking at the third U.R. Ananthamurthy Memorial Lecture in Bengaluru he underlined the need for the overhaul of the liberal idea and the need to find root in Indian culture. I could not agree more. 

My feelings are borne not because of the love for Modi government but rather the opposite. I am of the strong opinion that the left, liberal-left of this county is simply not Indian enough. Through the Hitler-Nazi-Mussolini connection and logic of the protest messaging the protestors strategically are only reaching the Instagram-Twitter savvy youth of the country. What more I heard some students sing Hindi translations of “Bella ciao”- Italian protest folk song that originated in the hardships of the mondina women, the paddy field workers in the late 19th century. My instant reaction was - “give me a f**king break”. Where is the good old, - “सरफरोशी की तमन्ना अब हमारे दिल में है, देखना है जोर कितना बाजु-कातिल में है?”

This kind of protest strategy borrowed from the histories of the west is simply does not seem an effective strategy to me. Where are the “Modi as Ravana”, “Modi as Kansa” narratives? Where are songs Hindi and Tamil songs describing the cruelty they feel. The present strategy followed by the anti-BJP camps are simply of a side either not capable of understanding India well enough or simply refusing to seek acceptance of an India that overwhelmingly voted for Modi in 2014 and 2019. 

The main strategy should be to win over Indians and subscribe to and hold dear values that large portions of Indians believe in: culture. I hope a new liberal polity of free market, free thought, small state, non interventionist, individualistic arises out of India that is rooted in Indian culture. There are enough classical liberal heroes in Indian history and we are ripe for a modern, scientific, cultural, liberal, individualism loving India. Think Basavanna, think Kabir, think C. Rajagopalachari, think Minoo Masani, think Tagore, think Raja Ram Mohan Roy, think Gokhale, Sri Aurobindo, think Pratap Bhanu Mehta and many more.
