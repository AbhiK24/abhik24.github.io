So I agree that the title is a little clickbaity. But here is a very small notes on my current state of mind on public poetry. By public poetry I mean the ones we read on Instagram, and the internet and bookshops and the ones we are subject to on terrible open mic poetry circuit.  In the era of ChatGPT, LLMs (Large Language Models), and the ongoing AI revolution it is needless to say that it would be hard to predict human written poetry from computer generated ones.
